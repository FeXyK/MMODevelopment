# MMODevelopment

This project was made for BSc Independent laboratory class at Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

The project uses two servers at the backend, and a client application which used by the useres to interact with the "virtual world"
##Login server
one is which responsible to handle the account informations like credentials, etc..., while keeps the connection secure with RSA.
##Game server
The other server is the game server, this server contains the data of the entities in the virtual world, and informs the clients about the recent changes.
##Client
Also the client side of the project was made in Unity.

For the networking I used lidgren networking library: https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3
